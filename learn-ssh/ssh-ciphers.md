| Cipher                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)                 | A symmetric-key cipher widely used for secure data encryption. Provides strong encryption and is considered secure.                                                         |
| 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard)             | A symmetric-key block cipher that applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm three times. It's relatively secure but less so than AES.                            |
| Blowfish                                           | A symmetric-key block cipher known for its fast encryption and strong security. It's considered secure, though not as widely used as AES.                                   |
| ChaCha20                                           | A stream cipher designed for speed and security. It is known for being highly secure and efficient.                                                                         |
| RSA (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman)                        | An asymmetric-key cipher used for public key encryption and digital signatures. RSA is widely used for key exchange in SSH.                                                 |
| DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)                  | An asymmetric-key algorithm used for digital signatures. It's often used for SSH key authentication.                                                                        |
| ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) | An asymmetric-key algorithm that provides strong security with smaller key sizes, making it more efficient. Commonly used for SSH key authentication.                       |
| Ed25519                                            | A specific implementation of the EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for strong security and performance. It's gaining popularity for SSH key authentication. |
