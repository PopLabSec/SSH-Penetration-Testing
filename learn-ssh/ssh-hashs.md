# ðŸŸ¢ SSH Hashs

| Hash Algorithm                                | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MD5 (Message Digest 5)                        | A widely-used cryptographic hash function. MD5 is fast but considered weak due to vulnerabilities, making it less secure.                                            |
| SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)               | Another widely-used cryptographic hash function. SHA-1 is also considered weak due to vulnerabilities and is being phased out in favor of stronger hashes.           |
| SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256)           | Part of the SHA-2 family, SHA-256 provides strong security with a 256-bit digest. It's widely used in SSH for data integrity.                                        |
| SHA-384 (Secure Hash Algorithm 384)           | Another member of the SHA-2 family, SHA-384 provides even stronger security with a 384-bit digest. It's used for high-security applications.                         |
| SHA-512 (Secure Hash Algorithm 512)           | Part of the SHA-2 family, SHA-512 offers the highest level of security with a 512-bit digest. It's used in critical applications where strong security is essential. |
| SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)               | A family of cryptographic hash functions designed to provide resistance to various types of attacks. It offers security and robustness.                              |
| HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) | A construction for creating a specific type of cryptographic hash that provides data integrity and authentication. It's commonly used in SSH for verifying data.     |
