# Readme

SSH is an application layer protocol that provides an encrypted session between two networked devices. It is often used to connect to web servers, UNIX systems, and other services.&#x20;

SSH encrypts the session and ensures data is transmitted securely over an untrusted network.&#x20;

Some of the common functions of SSH include logins, file transfers, management of remote servers, and tunneling of traffic.
