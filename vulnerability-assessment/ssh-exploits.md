# SSH Exploits

SSH (Secure Shell) exploits target vulnerabilities within the SSH protocol or implementations to gain unauthorized access or control over a remote system.&#x20;

Common types of SSH exploits include brute force attacks, where attackers repeatedly guess passwords, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where the communication between a client and server is intercepted and potentially altered.&#x20;

Software flaws and misconfigurations in SSH services can also be exploited to bypass authentication or execute arbitrary code. Mitigations include using strong passwords, key-based authentication, up-to-date software, and disabling unused features.

### Terrapin attack

The Terrapin attack is a sophisticated method that exploits vulnerabilities in SSH to bypass authentication mechanisms.&#x20;

Often facilitated through outdated or misconfigured servers, this attack allows adversaries to manipulate SSH communication, facilitating unauthorized access.&#x20;

Mitigations against such attacks include regularly updating SSH implementations, employing strong authentication methods, and monitoring for unusual activity.&#x20;

Due to its complexity, the Terrapin attack highlights the critical need for robust security practices in SSH configurations.
