# ðŸŸ¢ CVE-2008-0166

CVE-2008-0166 is a vulnerability that affected the random number generator used in Debian-based systems for generating SSL and SSH keys.&#x20;

This flaw, present between September 2006 and May 13, 2008, resulted in predictable cryptographic keys, making it easier for attackers to guess keys and compromise security.&#x20;

The vulnerability was introduced due to a change in the OpenSSL package that significantly weakened the randomness of generated keys. Systems using these keys should regenerate and replace them immediately.

For more details and mitigation steps, refer to the exploit documentation:
